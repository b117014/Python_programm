### NumPy
 - Numpy is linear algebra library for python.
 - The reason it is so important for data science with python is that almost all of the libraries in Pydata Ecosystem rely on NumpPy as one of their main building blocks.
 - NumPy is also incredibly fast, as it has binding to C libraries.

 - Numpy arrays essentially come in 2 flavors: vectors and matrices.
 - Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are 2-d.

 #### Example 
- cast a list into numPy array.
  > list = [1,2,3,4]
  > import numpy as np
  > arr = np.array(list);   // array([1,2,3,4])
